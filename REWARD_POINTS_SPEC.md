‚ú® Lore of the Mint Essence & the Arcforge

In the beginning, there was only raw Force... drifting across the realms unseen.
When the Astral War shattered the Veil, fragments of ancient magic crystallized into what sages now call Mint Essence ‚Äî a rare soulbound energy that clings only to those who duel with purpose.

This ethereal substance cannot be traded, sold, or stolen. It binds to the very will of its bearer ‚Äî earned only in combat, loyalty, and through bonds forged in the Crucible of Duels. It is whispered that those who gather enough of this essence may invoke the ancient ritual known as the Arcforge.

The Arcforge is no mere minting machine ‚Äî it is a forge of fate.

Fed by Mint Essence, the Arcforge consumes your soulbound victories and summons an OG Wizard. These first-born entities are known as the Original Generation, or ‚ÄúOGs‚Äù ‚Äî unique, eternal, and irreplaceable. Their power echoes the earliest magic and will never be seen again once the ritual ends.

‚ÄúWhen the Arcforge goes dark, no power in this world shall reignite it. Only those who rose during the Essence Era shall carry its legacy.‚Äù
